            <h2>About the Program</h2>
            <p>During this intensive program, high school students will have the opportunity to learn from our Crimson editors, who are current Harvard students who have went through similar college application process.The program will feature engaging discussions and workshops run by our trained Crimson staff and a guest speaker, dedicated to reviewing the Common Applicationâ€™s personal statement and additional supplemental college essays, developing long-term strategies to excel in the college admissions process, and preparing for college interviews. Students will also have the chance to partake in individual review sessions, during which each student will be paired up with a Harvard undergraduate and will receive a comprehensive, tailored review of their college application, essays, and high school career.</p>

            <p>We think this is a unique experience that high achieving students can take advantage of to gain better understanding of the mystic college application process and Harvard.</p>
